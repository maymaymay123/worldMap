# About
It is a simple game to guess how many countries there are in the world. 
You may have criss-cross the european countries, ticked off all the other most popular countries. You may have even made a dent in some of the less popular destinations. 
But how many countries you can actually guess? 
Hopefully throughout this game, it will bring you attention to some of the countries that you have never heard of, and thus, find out more about the countries in terms of their culture, religion, political views, geography, etc.
