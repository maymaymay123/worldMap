# World Map


# About
It is a simple game to see how many countries you can guess in the world. 
You may have criss-crossed the European countries, and ticked off all the other most popular countries. You may have even made a dent in some of the less popular destinations. 

But how many countries can you actually name? 
Hopefully throughout this game, it will bring you attention to some of the countries that you have never heard of, and thus, find out more about the countries in terms of their people, culture, religion, languages, political views, geography, etc.
